ðŸª· Fractol ðŸª·

Fractol was a graphic project developed by me as a cadet at 42 Rio. In said project, I was asked to build a graphic concoction of a fractal - a common yet complex, mesmerizing, visually enticing formation that can be found even in nature itself.
I designed the project by learning how to properly set and manipulate structs in C and the mini-libx library, a graphic library used by 42 students worldwide. The fractal formed on screen is a responsive one - you can zoom in and out of it, change its colors and exit
the program by clicking the 'x' button or pressing the ESC key.
