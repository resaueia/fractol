🖇️ Fractol 🖇️

Fractol was a graphic project developed by me as a cadet at 42 Rio. In said project, I was asked to build a graphic concoction of a fractal - a common yet complex, mesmerizing, visually enticing formation that can be found even in nature itself.
I designed the project by learning how to properly set and manipulate structs in C and the mini-libx library, a graphic library used by 42 students worldwide. The fractal formed on screen is a responsive one - you can zoom in and out of it, change its colors,
navigate up, down, left and right via the arrow keys on the keyboard and exit the program by clicking the 'x' button or pressing the ESC key.
